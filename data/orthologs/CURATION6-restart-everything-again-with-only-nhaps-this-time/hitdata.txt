They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

Transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized, and all of these catalyze Na+:H+ exchange. Their primary physiological functions may be in (1) cytoplasmic pH regulation, extruding the H+ generated during metabolism, and (2) salt tolerance (in plants), due to Na+ uptake into vacuoles. This model is specific for the bacterial members of this family. [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds]

Transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized, and all of these catalyze Na+:H+ exchange. Their primary physiological functions may be in (1) cytoplasmic pH regulation, extruding the H+ generated during metabolism, and (2) salt tolerance (in plants), due to Na+ uptake into vacuoles. This model is specific for the bacterial members of this family. [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds]

The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

Their primary physiological functions may be in(1) cytoplasmic pH regulation, extruding the H+ generated during metabolism, and (2) salt tolerance (in plants), due to Na+ uptake into vacuoles.This model is specific for the eukaryotic members members of this family.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

Transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized, and all of these catalyze Na+:H+ exchange.

The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.

The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share identity with other members of the family. The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is thought to be the region that is involved in the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasmic region has little similarity throughout the family.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

Transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized, and all of these catalyze Na+:H+ exchange. Their primary physiological functions may be in (1) cytoplasmic pH regulation, extruding the H+ generated during metabolism, and (2) salt tolerance (in plants), due to Na+ uptake into vacuoles. This model is specific for the bacterial members of this family. [Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron carrying compounds]

This group includes enzymes from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Aquifex aeolicus, the spirochete Treponema pallidum, Synechocystis PCC6803, and one of the two prolyL-tRNA synthetases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other group includes the Pro-specific domain of a human multifunctional tRNA ligase and the prolyl-tRNA synthetases from the Archaea, the Mycoplasmas, and the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

The functions of Ubl1 in CoVs are related to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding and to interacting with the nucleocapsid (N) protein. SARS-CoV Ubl1 has been shown to bind ssRNA having AUA patterns, and since the 5'-UTR of the SARS-CoV genome has a number of AUA repeats, it may bind there. In mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), this Ubl1 domain binds the cognate N protein. Adjacent to Ubl1 is a Glu-rich acidic region (also referred to as hypervariable region, HVR); Ubl1 together with HVR has been called Nsp3a. Currently, the function of HVR in CoVs is unknown. This model corresponds to one of two Ubl domains in Nsp3; the other is located N-terminal to the papain-like protease (PLpro) and is not represented by this model.

In addition, GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This family, also referred to as soluble GSTs, is the largest family of GSH transferases and is only distantly related to the mitochondrial GSTs (GSTK). Soluble GSTs bear no structural similarity to microsomal GSTs (MAPEG family) and display additional activities unique to their group, such as catalyzing thiolysis, reduction  and isomerization of certain compounds. The GST fold contains an N-terminal thioredoxin-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. GSH binds to the N-terminal domain while the hydrophobic substrate occupies a pocket in the C-terminal domain. Based on sequence similarity, different classes of GSTs have been identified, which display varying tissue distribution, substrate specificities and additional specific activities. In humans, GSTs display polymorphisms which may influence individual susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, arthritis, allergy and sclerosis. Some GST family members with non-GST functions include glutaredoxin 2, the CLIC subfamily of anion channels, prion protein Ure2p, crystallins, metaxins, stringent starvation protein A, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

Class II amino acyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) share a common fold and generally attach an amino acid to the 3' OH of ribose of the appropriate tRNA.   PheRS is an exception in that it attaches the amino acid at the 2'-OH group, like class I aaRSs. These enzymes are usually homodimers. This domain is primarily responsible for ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. The substrate specificity of this reaction is further determined by additional domains. Intererestingly, this domain is also found is asparagine synthase A (AsnA), in the accessory subunit of mitochondrial polymerase gamma and in the bacterial  ATP  phosphoribosyltransferase regulatory subunit HisZ.

Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops.

Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.

The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share identity with other members of the family. The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is thought to be the region that is involved in the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasmic region has little similarity throughout the family.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

They play an essential role in cell survival by regulating spore formation, competence, and biofilm development. AbrB is one of the most known TSRs, acting as a pleotropic regulator for over 60 different genes where it directly binds to their promoter or regulatory regions. Many other genes are indirectly controlled by AbrB since it is a regulator of other regulatory proteins, including ScoC, Abh, SinR and SigH. Hence, AbrB is considered a global regulatory protein controlling processes such as Bacillus subtilis growth and cell division as well as production of extracellular degradative enzymes, nitrogen utilization and amino acid metabolism, motility, synthesis of antibiotics and their resistant determinants, development of competence, transport systems, oxidative stress response, phosphate metabolism, cell surface components and sporulation. AbrB is a tetramer consisting of identical 94 residue monomers. Its DNA-binding function resides solely in the N-terminal domain (AbrBN) of 53 residues. Although it does not recognize a well-defined DNA base-pairing sequence, instead, it appears to target a very weak pseudo consensus nucleotide sequence, TGGNA-5bp-TGGNA, which allows it to be rather promiscuous in binding. The N-terminal domains of very similar sequences are present in two more Bacillus subtilis proteins, Abh and SpoVT. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the role of the C-terminal domain is in forming multimers.

The molecular mechanisms of antiport are unclear. These antiporters contain 10-12 transmembrane regions (M) at the amino-terminus and a large cytoplasmic region at the carboxyl terminus. The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share identity with other members of the family. The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is thought to be the region that is involved in the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasmic region has little similarity throughout the family.
